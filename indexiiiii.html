<p>I think it goes without saying that art and it's experience is unique to each individual. I don't exactly feel anything when I look at the art of today though.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people feel this way; though, at the same time I'm sure it can be applied to the opposite as well. Is there something I'm not seeing?</p>
